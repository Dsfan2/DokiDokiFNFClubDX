Sayori::Evil1::L::"And by the looks of things, you're already hogging The Boyfriend to yourself!"

Monika::JM-Upset::M::"S...Sayori?! W...What happened to you?"
BF::Worried::R::"Yeah...Something seems...off with you. Aren't your eyes supposed to be blue?"
@edit-font::
Sayori::Evil2::L::"That's not important!"
Sayori::Evil3::L::"Monika, you're gonna pay for everything you have done to me, Yuri, and Natsuki!"

Monika::JM-Upset::M::"Hold on...I...You...You don't understand!"
@edit-font::
Sayori::Evil2::L::"Oh I understand your goal, Monika!"
Sayori::Evil2::L::"You wanted to have BF all for yourself, so you deleted everyone else, including his girlfriend!"

@normal-font::
BF::Angry::R::"She never deleted anyone! She told me that she just moved everyone else's character files temporarily."
BF::Angry::R::"So, sure. She may have done some questionable actions to get here, but I don't blame her!"
BF::Angry::R::"Heck, I'd probably go crazy like that if I knew I was in an infinately repeating simulation!"
BF::Upset::R::

Sayori::Evil1::L::"Y...You're...Defending her?"
Sayori::Evil2::L::"But...I thought...You wanted to be with me forever after what Monika did?!"

Sayori::Evil4::L::"Well...too bad! Thanks to my self-awareness and elevated access being on the same level as Monika's..."

Sayori::Evil3::L::"Yes I can! I can do anything!"
Sayori::Evil1::L::"So, how about a little wager..."
Sayori::Evil1::L::"If you can beat me, I'll leave you all be."
Sayori::Evil4::L::"But if you lose, I'll delete Monika's character file, and you will be my soulmate for the rest of eternity!"
