BF::Worried::R::"Ugh...GF did your dad really have to do that?"
BF::Worried::R::"Wait...why am I talking in English instead of Beepeeze?"
GF::Worried::M::"My guess is that the game's language setting is set to English."
GF::Worried::M::"Also, trapping people in video games is just one of my dad's guilty pleasures."
BF::Scared::R::"Wait...What?"
GF::Worried::M::"You'd be surprised at how many people he trapped in video games, other than those that've tried to date me."
GF::Normal::M::
BF::Scared::R::"And your dad does this on a regular basis?!"
GF::Worried::M::"He doesn't do it all the time. He does it like once every week."
BF::Worried::R::"That's still very concerning!"
GF::Speak::M::"I think we should worry about that later. There are bigger questions at hand still."
GF::Normal::M::
BF::Speak::R::"Yeah, you're right. We need to focus on getting out of here."
BF::Worried::R::"By the way, what even is this place? Is this some sort of school?"
GF::Speak::M::"Well, this game is called Doki Doki Literature Club Plus."
GF::Normal::M::
BF::Speak::R::"Well, no time to be asking silly questions! I'm sure we can find a way out in here somewhere!"

BF::Worried::R::"We've searched pretty much everywhere for a long time, and still no sign of any ways of getting out..."
GF::Speak::M::"Hey wait...do you hear that?"
GF::Speak::M::
BF::Worried::R::"Huh?"
GF::Speak::M::"I think I hear some chattering coming from this room."
GF::Normal::M::
BF::Speak::R::"Do you think that someone else is here?"
BF::Normal::R::
GF::Speak::M::"It's possible...Only one way to find out though."

Monika::Confused::L::"Hello? Is anyone there?"
BF::Speak::R::"Uh, hi there... My girlfriend and I are kinda lost here."
BF::Normal::R::
Monika::Confused::L::"Huh? Lost?"
GF::Speak::M::"Yeah... We've been looking for a way out of here for a while now, but we've had no luck..."
BF::Normal::R::
Monika::Confused::L::"Huh... That's a bit odd..."
Monika::Pose::L::"Well if you're looking for a way out, maybe my friends and I could help you."
Monika::Normal::L::
BF::Speak::R::"Uh, sure. I guess it's better than standing out in the open and waiting for something to happen..."
BF::Normal::R::
Monika::Happy::L::"Great! Come on in!"

Monika::Pose::L::"Hey everyone, we've got a couple of guests joining us today!"
Monika::Normal::L::
GF::Speak::M::"Uh...Hi."
GF::Normal::M::
BF::Speak::R::"Heh...Hello."
BF::Normal::R::
Sayori::Pose::L::"Oooh! You two look so adorable!"
Yuri::Pose::L::"W...Welcome to the literature club. It's a pleasure meeting you."
BF::Normal::R::So this is the so-called Literature Club.
Natsuki::Pose::L::"Seriously?! You let a boy in?! Way to kill the atmosphere!"
Monika::Pose::L::"Don't be mean Natsuki, there's another girl here too."
Natsuki::Pose::L::(Well at least I won't have to feel like the shortest anymore)
BF::Worried::R::"Yo, why is this club full of incredibly cute girls?"
GF::Worried::M::"Beats me..."
GF::Normal::M::
Sayori::Pose::L::"Hey! Is that a microphone?!"
BF::Worried::R::"Y...Yeah."
Sayori::Pose::L::"Well, why don't you sing for us?"
Natsuki::Pose::L::"Hey! Are you in charge here?!"
Monika::Pose::L::"Actually, music is a unique form of literature. So this kid can definately sing for us."
Monika::Yoga::L::"...Can you?"
BF::Worried::R::"Well... We are supposed to be searching for a way out of here... but..."
BF::Speak::R::"Eh... what the heck..."
BF::Sass::R::"I can't say no to a rap battle! Especially if there's no risk of dying involved!"
BF::Normal::R::
Sayori::Yay::L::"Yay!"
Yuri::Pose::L::"Okay then...Let's see what you've got..."
Natsuki::Pose::L::"Wait...don't we need music for this?"
Monika::Pose::L::"Luckily, I keep some speakers in the closet."
BF::Worried::R::"You keep speakers in the closet?"
Monika::Normal::L::"Only for rare occasions like this."
GF::Speak::M::"Great! Something for me to sit and bob my head on."
GF::Normal::M::
BF::Speak::R::"Uh...okay then. Let's do this!"
