BF::Worried::R::"Ugh...GF did your dad really have to do that?"
BF::Worried::R::"Wait...why am I talking in English instead of Beepeeze?"
GF::Worried::M::"My guess is that the game's language setting is set to English."
GF::Worried::M::"Also, trapping people in video games is just one of my dad's guilty pleasures."
BF::Scared::R::"Wait...What?"
GF::Worried::M::"You'd be surprised at how many people he trapped in video games, other than those that've tried to date me."
GF::Normal::M::
BF::Scared::R::"And your dad does this on a regular basis?!"
GF::Worried::M::"He doesn't do it all the time. He does it like once every week."
BF::Worried::R::"That's still very concerning!"
GF::Speak::M::"I think we should worry about that later. There are bigger questions at hand still."
GF::Normal::M::
BF::Speak::R::"Yeah, you're right. We need to focus on getting out of here."
BF::Worried::R::"By the way, what even is this place? Is this some sort of school?"
GF::Speak::M::"Well, this game is called Doki Doki Literature Club Plus."

GF::Normal::M::
BF::Speak::R::"Well, no time to be asking silly questions! I'm sure we can find a way out in here somewhere!"

GF::Speak::M::"Hey wait...do you hear that?"
GF::Normal::M::
BF::Worried::R::"Huh?"
GF::Speak::M::"I think I hear some chattering coming from this room."
GF::Normal::M::
BF::Speak::R::"Do you think that someone else is here?"
BF::Normal::R::
GF::Speak::M::"There's only one way to find out."

Monika::Confused::L::"Hello? Is anyone there?"
BF::Speak::R::"Uh, hi there... My girlfriend and I are kinda lost here."
BF::Normal::R::
Monika::Confused::L::"Huh? Lost?"
GF::Speak::M::"Yeah, we're kinda trapped in here and looking for a way out. We were hoping someone here could help."
GF::Normal::M::
Monika::Confused::L::"Hmm...I don't think there's anyone else here now..."
Monika::Pose::L::"But you both can come in here if you'd like."
Monika::Normal::L::
BF::Speak::R::"Sure! I guess that'd be okay."

Monika::Normal::L::
GF::Speak::M::"Uh...Hi."
GF::Normal::M::
BF::Speak::R::"Heh...Hello."
BF::Normal::R::
Yuri::Pose::L::"G...guests?"
Sayori::Pose::L::"Oooh! You two look so adorable!"
Natsuki::Pose::L::"Seriously?! You let a boy in?! Way to kill the atmosphere!"
Monika::Pose::L::"Don't be mean Natsuki, there's another girl here too."
Natsuki::Pose::L::(Well at least I won't have to feel like the shortest anymore)
Monika::Pose::L::"Anyways, we're the Literature Club!"
BF::Normal::R::So this is the so-called Literature Club.
BF::Worried::R::"But, why is this club full of incredibly cute girls?"
GF::Worried::M::"Beats me..."
GF::Normal::M::
Sayori::Pose::L::"Hey! Is that a microphone?!"
BF::Worried::R::"Y...Yeah."
Sayori::Pose::L::"Well, why don't you sing for us?"
Natsuki::Pose::L::"Hey! Are you in charge here?!"
Monika::Pose::L::"Actually, music is a unique form of literature. So this kid can definately sing for us."
Monika::Yoga::L::"...Can you?"

Yuri::Pose::L::"Okay then...Let's see what you've got..."
Natsuki::Pose::L::"Wait...don't we need music for this?"
Monika::Pose::L::"Luckily, I keep some speakers in the closet."
BF::Worried::R::"You keep speakers in the closet?"
Monika::Normal::L::"Only for rare occasions like this."
GF::Worried::M::
@autoskip::"Uh...BF, I really don't think this is the right time for singing..."
