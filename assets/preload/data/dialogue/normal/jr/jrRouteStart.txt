Bowser Jr::Worried::R::"Ugh...what happened? Where am I?"
Bowser Jr::Worried::R::"I remember getting ready for my Dad's Epic Wonder Concert, but then I got dragged into this glitchy portal."
Bowser Jr::Worried::R::"..."
Bowser Jr::Worried::R::"This place kind of looks like... some sort of school?"
Bowser Jr::Speak::R::"Well, I'm not staying here! I'm too cool for school!"
Bowser Jr::Speak::R::"And I don't want to miss my Dad's Epic Wonder Concert!"

Bowser Jr::Worried::R::"..."
Bowser Jr::Worried::R::"I think it's coming from this room."

Monika::Confused::L::"Hello? Is anyone there?"
Bowser Jr::Speak::R::"Woah, who are you?"
Bowser Jr::Normal::R::
Monika::Scared::L::"ACK! What the heck are you?!"
Bowser Jr::Sass::R::"Ohhh... do I scare you lady?"
Monika::Scared::L::"Well, kind of... I mean, you are a talking dragon-turtle thing..."
Bowser Jr::Sass::R::"Hehehehe! Look upon me in fear! I'll kidnap you and bring you to my Dad!"
Bowser Jr::Normal::R::"..."
Monika::Confused::L::
Bowser Jr::Worried::R::"That is... if I can find a way out of here... I'm kinda lost at the moment..."
Monika::Confused::L::"Well, you can come in here if you want. I'm sure my friends can help you."
Bowser Jr::Speak::R::"Okay, if that's the case, how about we call it a truce for now..."

Bowser Jr::Sass::R::"Behold fools! The great-"
Bowser Jr::Normal::R::
Sayori::Pose::L::"Woah! A talking animal? I thought those only existed in movies & TV!"
Yuri::Pose::L::"You do look kind of... off-putting... to say the least..."
Yuri::Normal::L::"But I welcome you to the Literature Club regardless."
Natsuki::Pose::L::"Monika! What the heck is that thing?! Why do you keep inviting weirdos to our club?!"
Monika::Pose::L::"Don't be mean Natsuki."
Natsuki::Pose::L::(Well at least I won't have to feel like the shortest anymore)
Bowser Jr::Sass::R::"Oh wow! I hit the jackpot! 4 ladies to kidnap! My Dad would be so proud of me!"
Bowser Jr::Worried::R::"But then again, none of these girls look like Princess Peach, so I won't kidnap them... for now..."
Sayori::Pose::L::"Hey! Is that a microphone?!"
Bowser Jr::Worried::R::"O...Oh! This? Yeah, I was gonna perform at my Dad's Epic Wonder Concert, but I somehow ended up here..."
Sayori::Pose::L::"Well, why don't you sing for us?"
Natsuki::Pose::L::"Hey! Are you in charge here?!"
Monika::Pose::L::"Actually, music is a unique form of literature. So this... creature... can definetely sing for us."
Monika::Yoga::L::"...Can you?"
Bowser Jr::Worried::R::"Well, I was searching for a way out of here... but..."
Bowser Jr::Speak::R::"Eh, what the heck. I guess I can sing for you girls."
Bowser Jr::Sass::R::"It'd be a great warm-up for when I finally challenge Mario & his friends!"
Bowser Jr::Normal::R::
Sayori::Yay::L::"Yay!"
Yuri::Pose::L::"Okay then...Let's see what you've got..."
Natsuki::Pose::L::"Wait...don't we need music for this?"
Monika::Pose::L::"Luckily, I keep some speakers in the closet."
Bowser Jr::Worried::R::"You keep speakers in the closet?"
Monika::Normal::L::"Only for rare occasions like this."
Bowser Jr::Speak::R::"Uh...okay then. Let's do this!"
