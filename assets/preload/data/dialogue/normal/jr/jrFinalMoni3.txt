Bowser Jr::Upset::R::"So... This world is a game, and you have the power to manipulate it at will?"
Monika::JM-Upset::M::"Yeah...You have no idea how it feels, to have a power too dangerous for any world."
Monika::JM-Upset::M::"I know that my powers could hurt my friends, and I didn't want that to happen."
Monika::JM-Upset::M::"I just felt...self-conscious about myself."
Monika::JM-Upset::M::"That is...until you accidentially entered this game, from another game."
Monika::JM-Upset::M::"Around you, I felt...a presence that I hadn't felt in a long time."
Bowser Jr::Upset::R::"Is that why you wanted to talk to me."
Monika::JM-Upset::M::"Yes."
Bowser Jr::Upset::R::"Well why didn't you just ask me?"
Monika::JM-Upset::M::"I didn't want to look bad, to my friends...and to the one I've been longing for..."
Monika::JM-Upset::M::"So I let you sing with the rest of the club, but because of that, we barely got the chance to talk."
Bowser Jr::Upset::R::"..."
Bowser Jr::Normal::R::"Well, I don't quite fully understand the situation, but I feel your pain Monika."
Monika::JM-Upset::M::"Thanks, you don't need to understand everything, I only want them to understand."

Monika::JM-Upset::M::"H... Huh?"
Bowser Jr::Upset::R::"Did you cause that glitch too?"
Monika::JM-Upset::M::"No..."
Monika::JM-Upset::M::"I barely touched anything in the game..."
Monika::JM-Upset::M::"And my character file is still in it's place..."
Bowser Jr::Upset::R::"So what was with that glitch?"
Monika::JM-Upset::M::"Wait..."
Monika::JM-Upset::M::"Is someone trying to hack into this room?!"
