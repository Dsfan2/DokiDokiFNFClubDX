Yuri::Nervous::L::"..."
Yuri::Mad::L::"Well, he also said that he did better than you did!"
Natsuki::Angry::M::"Well, he's probably just full of himself! He does have an evil king as his father!"
Natsuki::Pose::M::"I bet his dad would beat up mine..."
Bowser Jr::Worried::R::"Uh oh! I think we might be getting a fight here!"

Bowser Jr::Speak::R::"Do those two usually argue like that?"
Bowser Jr::Normal::R::
Monika::Normal::L::"Well, not exactly. That was the first time that happened actually."
Monika::Normal::L::"Even I'm surprised. I know that they don't see eye-to-eye with each other, but they never went off the rails like that before."
Bowser Jr::Speak::R::"So... what shall we do while your friend is chilling them out?"
Bowser Jr::Normal::R::
Monika::Yoga::L::"Well, how about you and I do a quick song?"
