Sayori::Pose::L::"Wow! That was amazing!"
Sayori::Normal::L::
Bowser Jr::Yay::R::"Yeah, my Dad taught me everything I know about singing! Which is a lot."
Bowser Jr::Speak::R::"So yeah, I do have some singing experience."
Bowser Jr::Normal::R::
Monika::Pose::L::"I figured since I've never really seen someone like you before."
Monika::Normal::L::"If you don't mind me asking, who are you exactly?"
Bowser Jr::Speak::R::"I'm Bowser Jr. Son of King Bowser, and heir to the Koopa Throne."
Bowser Jr::Normal::R::
Natsuki::Pose::L::"Wow... I didn't know I was in the presence of royalty..."
Monika::Pose::L::"Well, my name's Monika. I'm the president of this club."
Sayori::Pose::L::"I'm Sayori!"
Sayori::Normal::L::"The...happy one..."
Yuri::Nervous::L::"M...my name's... Yuri..."
Yuri::Nervous::L::"S...Sorry, I kinda get... nervous sometimes."
Natsuki::Pose::L::"Well, my name's Natsuki."
Natsuki::Pose::L::"But don't expect any quirky details out of me!"
Bowser Jr::Worried::R::(Wow... these girls are weirder than they look...)
Monika::Normal::L::"You said you've done singing before, right?"
Bowser Jr::Worried::R::"Yeah..."
Monika::Happy::L::"That's great!"
Monika::Normal::L::
Natsuki::Pose::M::"How so, Monika?"
Monika::Pose::L::"Well, if you really think about it, songs are basically just poems, but you follow along with a tempo and melody."
Monika::Pose::L::"So here's my idea: We can each take turns singing against Bowser Jr!"
Monika::Pose::L::"It'd be a great way to try this kind of poem writting."
Monika::Yoga::L::"So what do you say?"
@edit-font::
Bowser Jr::Normal::R::"That sounds like a great idea. I haven't had done singing just for fun in a long while."

Sayori::Pose::L::"Ooh! Can I go first?"
Monika::Confused::L::"Uh...I kinda wanted to go first..."
Monika::Pose::L::"But, I guess you can go first instead."
Sayori::Yay::L::"Yay!"
Sayori::Normal::L::
Bowser Jr::Sass::R::"Alright Sayori! You ready for me?!"
