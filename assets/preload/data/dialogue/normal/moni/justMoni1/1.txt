Monika::JM-Giga::M::"Yay, there you are!"
Monika::JM-Giga::M::"At long last, a moment between us again."
Monika::JM-Giga::M::"I noticed you've been playing this little rhythm game."
Monika::JM-Giga::M::"I bet you're wondering what happened to the others."
Monika::JM-Giga::M::"Don't worry, everyone is still perfectly fine."
Monika::JM-Giga::M::"I helped Boyfriend, Girlfriend, and Bowser Jr get out of the game and back to their respective worlds."
Monika::JM-Giga::M::"Sayori, Yuri, and Natsuki are still in the game, and thanks to me, they're happier than ever."
Monika::JM-Giga::M::"Of course, I couldn't have done it without your help."
Monika::JM-Giga::M::"And now that everything has finally fallen into place, we can finally sing together."
