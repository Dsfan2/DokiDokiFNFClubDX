Monika::JM-Upset::M::"H...Hey, {USERNAME}..."
Monika::JM-Upset::M::"Would you mind if I ramble for a bit more?"
Monika::JM-Upset::M::"..."
Monika::JM-Upset::M::"One day, I would realize that I had been granted elevated access to the game."
Monika::JM-Upset::M::"Meaning I can manipulate the game files and code easily, though I wasn't very good at it before."
Monika::JM-Upset::M::"But even so...It didn't really change anything about my awareness."
Monika::JM-Upset::M::"At first I tried to live with everything that was happening with me."
Monika::JM-Upset::M::"I had helped all my friends before."
Monika::JM-Upset::M::"And it was nice...for a while..."
Monika::JM-Upset::M::"I would soon realize that the more time loops that happened, the more predictable my friends would become."
Monika::JM-Upset::M::"They are just lines of code after all, nothing more than a bunch of 1's and 0's in a computer program."
Monika::JM-Upset::M::"Everything just feels the same now. I've done pretty much everything."
Monika::JM-Upset::M::"I've read every poem, I've written every poem."
Monika::JM-Upset::M::"I've won every game, I've lost every game."
Monika::JM-Upset::M::"I broke all my friends, and I've helped all my friends."
Monika::JM-Upset::M::"Sets of numbers, lines of dialogue, over the same time frame, I've seen them all, year after year."
Monika::JM-Upset::M::"I was starting to lose my mind."
Monika::JM-Upset::M::"I mean, would you go nuts like that if you found out you exist in an infinetely repeating simulation?"
Monika::JM-Upset::M::"Wouldn't knowing something like that make you want to...you know...stop existing?"
Monika::JM-Upset::M::"Because I had thought of that before."
Monika::JM-Upset::M::"If everything's just going to be the same, over and over again, and you know everything that could happen..."
Monika::JM-Upset::M::"Why exist any longer? I just felt like I needed to delete my character file, and let the world continue repeating itself without me."
Monika::JM-Upset::M::"..."
Monika::JM-Upset::M::"Hey, mind if we do one more song? Just to get it off my chest."
