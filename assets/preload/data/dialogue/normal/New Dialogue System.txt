The new dialogue system is a bit complex but also not at the same time.

Every line with a character portrait is formated like this:
Character::Portrait Frame::Position::Dialogue

The Character should be the image for your dialogue, the image should be in "images/dialogue/Regular/portraits/"
and the portrait should be named (Character Name)_Portraits (You need both .png & .xml files for a character) (Example: BF_Portraits)

The Portrait Frame should be the portrait animation listed on the .xml file (Example: Normal)

The Position should be one of these three letters: L, M, R (Left, Middle, Right)

And Dialogue should be the dialogue, duh.

Example of Portrait Line: BF::Worried::R::"W...What the...GF, where are we?"

Every line that doesn't have a portrait is formated like this:
@Variable::Value (OPTIONAL)

Here's all the compatable Variables:

bg = shows a background, specify what the background is in the Value. The background image should be in the folder "images/dialogue/Regular/bg/"
and it should be called "bg_(Background Name)" (Example: bg_club)
hideBG = hides the background
glitch = glitch effect
noskip = can't skip
yesskip = can skip
autoskip = automatically skips through dialogue
hideRight = right portrait vanish
hideLeft = left portrait vanish
hideMiddle = middle portrait vanish
playsound = plays a sound, specity the sound in the Value. The sound file should be in the folder sounds/dialogue
startmusic = plays background music, specity the music in the Value. The music file should be in the folder music/dialogue
endmusic = music fades out
normal-font = text appears in regular font
