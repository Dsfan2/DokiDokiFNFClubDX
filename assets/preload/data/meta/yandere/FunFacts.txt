Yandere is an anime character trope that involves a character that is massively obsessive over their crushes to the point of murder. It's name in Japaneese literally derives from the words for mentally ill and lovey-dovey.
When Yuri gets ice cream, she prefers to have BLOOD on top. YOUR BLOOD to be precise. Aaaaaaand now I'm scared...
Unlike other mods... Yuri's voice doesn't change between normal and crazy. Which is quite an accomplishment actually...
I think Yuri wears 2 hairclips at once... The maniac...
Hi How Are Ya?
