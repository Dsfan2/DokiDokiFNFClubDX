Sometimes you'll find yourself faced with a difficult decision. When that happens, don't forget to save your game! You never know when you might wanna change your mind, or when something... unexpected may happen.
Sometimes when you're writing, or drawing something, your brain gets too fixated on a specific point... If you try so hard to make it perfect, then you'll never make any progress. Just force yourself to get something down on the paper, and tidy it up later!
Are you ever too shy to share your work because you're afraid it's not that good? It can be really disheartening to get a lukewarm response to something you put so much into. But if you find other people who enjoy what you like, then sharing becomes a lot easier!
Your life is everything! You serve all purpose! You should love yourself now! And treat yourself to a piece of that oxygen in the ozone layer! <3
This song went though a couple different iterations before being settled on the final version now. Much like a lot of other songs in this mod.
