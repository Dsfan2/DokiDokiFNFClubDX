The very first song from the very first version of the mod is this... Kinda nostalgic when you think about it...
Candy Hearts actually was not used in any of the Side Stories in DDLC Plus. It just kinda... hangs around in the music gallery...
As much as I hated the V1 & V2 Sprites, there's actually talk of bringing the V1 Sprites back for DOKI DOKI Remixes. I prefer to keep the V2 Sprites burned forever.
The background for the clubroom is different in the Classic Songs is different than the Normal Songs.
I hated Sayori's old voice soundfonts, especially the V1 one... All the V1 ones were garbage... I hated them...
