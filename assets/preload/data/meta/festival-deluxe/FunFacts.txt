This is it. The final song. Everything you've been through has been building up to this moment. Good luck!
You probably figured it out by now, but this is a remix of the song Triple Trouble from Vs Sonic.exe. A song that has been covered and remixed to death by many other mods, including this one.
I was originally gonna use SuperStamps' Festival BAD ENDING Instrumental for this, but I decided to create my own remixed instrumental instead.
If you've cleared every other song prior to this one, that means this is the last one in this mod before clearing every song!
Vs Sonic.exe was cool at the time, but now it's basically been copy-pasted by other creepypasta mods to death. Can Sonic.exe just die in peace already?!
