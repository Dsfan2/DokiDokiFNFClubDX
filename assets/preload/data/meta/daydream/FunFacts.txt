A person who does nothing but think all the time has nothing to think about except thoughts, causing them to lose touch with reality and live in a world of illusions.
Would you rather: No Thoughts Head Empty, or Many Thoughts Head Full?
If you want to be friends with Sayori, give her a cookie. It's as easy as that.
Sayori oversleeps not because she's depressed, but because she stayed up til midnight playing Genshin Impact...
I'd like to think Sayori secretly likes listening to rock music, because it's a funny headcanon thing lol.
