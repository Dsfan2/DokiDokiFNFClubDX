Reflection is actually the name of one of the side stories in DDLC Plus, specifically the one featuring Monika & Yuri.
There weren't many changes with the instrumental of this song, mainly just adjusting the volume of some instruments.
If you're a DDLC fan-artist, reflect on how you've portrayed Yuri. Go on... I'll wait...
Will you have tea with Yuri, or will this whole thing end like Komi Can't Communicate where Yuri speaks with a pen and paper?
Surprisingly, despite what the game would like you to believe, ou probably know that Yuri is more shy around people like MC, and is more comfortable with her friends from the literature club.
