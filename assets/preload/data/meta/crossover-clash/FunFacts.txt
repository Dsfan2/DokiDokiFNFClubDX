This is a playable version of Crossover Clash, which originated from a video I uploaded on October 29th 2022.
This song has gone through quite a few changes since the original upload. One noticable change is that a reference during the Monikas' part was replaced.
While the DDTO Dokis were made by DusterBuster, the poses were actually based on the versions from one of our previous mods: Doki Doki Takeover - Refresh Mix.
This is actually the third-longest song in the mod. Right behind 2 others that I'm sure you're aware of by now...
