Natsuki is the only one of the four main girls in DDLC that dosen't confess her love to the MC... Can't imagine why...
I originally wanted this to sound like an Anime opening. That didn't go as planned...
Except for Candy Heartz, this is the shortest song in the mod.
This song took multiple iterations to get it to sound good.
Outside of Kirby Right Back At Ya, I haven't actually watched any anime in my life... Would anybody change that for me, I don't know...
