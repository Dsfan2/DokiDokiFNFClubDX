I'm not claiming that Monika is a Dorodere because she is not evil. In fact, THAT'S why I'm making this mod in the first place.
Monika is best girl for all eternity. I will die on this hill!
In the DDLC 2018 Valentine's artworks, Monika canonically took the gifts the other girls made as her own. Get snuck upon.
If I had a nickel every time Monika got a Pop Up Parade figure, I'd have 2 nickels, which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice right?
Sometimes you'll find yourself faced with a difficult decision. When that happens, don't forget to save your game! You never know when you might wanna change your mind, or when something... unexpected may happen.
Sometimes when you're writing, or drawing something, your brain gets too fixated on a specific point... If you try so hard to make it perfect, then you'll never make any progress. Just force yourself to get something down on the paper, and tidy it up later!
Are you ever too shy to share your work because you're afraid it's not that good? It can be really disheartening to get a lukewarm response to something you put so much into. But if you find other people who enjoy what you like, then sharing becomes a lot easier!
Your life is everything! You serve all purpose! You should love yourself now! And treat yourself to a piece of that oxygen in the ozone layer! <3
Unlike the others, Monika's name is actually I Advise in Latin and Alone in Greek. Which... looking at them now... makes a whole lot of sense. :,(
I know you might think Monika's a villan because of her actons, or her green eyes (Green is a Disney Villan color), but just... please... think a little more deeply about Monika's situation. Okay?
Stop shipping Monika with Senpai. It's gross. Ship Monika with Dsfan2 (me) so we can all get on with our lives...
You do know that Doki Doki Takeover isn't the only DDLC Friday Night Funkin' mod, right? What about FNF X DDLC? We should talk about it more.
