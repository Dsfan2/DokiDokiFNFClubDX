If you want to be friends with Sayori, you can't. That's just the way the cookie crumbles...
Sayori oversleeps not because she stays up til midnight playing Genshin Impact, but because she's depressed...
I'd like to think Sayori secretly likes hanging around with her friends because she like it when they are happy...
When day is dark, alway rember: ...
Happy thoughts... Happy thoughts... Happy thoughts...

Does anybody know who originally called Sayori a Cinnamon Bun? Because she does not looks like a breakfast dish. She looks like... well... A person...
Cute and sweet... Cute and sweet... Cute and sweet...
