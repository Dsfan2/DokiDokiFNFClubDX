I added Bowser Jr to this mod because I didn't want to add the MC from DDLC, as he is such an afterthought... At least he's given more purpose in this update.
Going to Normal Freeplay is not necessary for completion of the mod, unless if you're attempting certain achievements or something.
Monika is a key playable character in this mod because yes.
Originally in the story Boyfriend & Bowser Jr were singing because apparently that was one way for them to escape the game. That whole plot hole was removed in this version...
If DusterBuster can include a Va11-Hall-A song in Doki Doki Takeover Plus, then I have every right to include Bowser Jr in this mod!
You want this Grand Star so bad? You're gonna have to take it from me! >:3
