If you want to be friends with Sayori, give her a cookie. It's as easy as that.
Sayori oversleeps not because she's depressed, but because she stayed up til midnight playing Genshin Impact...
I'd like to think Sayori secretly likes listening to rock music, because it's a funny headcanon thing lol.
When day is dark, alway rember: happi day!
I like having the happy thoughts! Don't you?
Sayori actually has a small ponytail where her bow is, and nobody noticed it 6 and a half years...
Does anybody know who originally called Sayori a Cinnamon Bun, and why it stuck with her?
Did you know that Sayori... Is the most family friendly member of the Literature Club?
Sayori likes eating cereal in front of a TV watching Saturday Morning Cartoons.         Okay probably not canonically but it definitely seems like something Sayori would do.
