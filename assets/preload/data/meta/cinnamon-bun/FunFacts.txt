Does anybody know who originally called Sayori a Cinnamon Bun, and why it stuck with her?
The previous version used the motif of Your Best Friend from Undertale way too much, and now it's been reduced to the end for the better.
There's a reference to a song from Mario Party 2 in this song. Which song is it? I'm sure you'll know it when you hear it.
Did you know that Sayori... Is the most family friendly member of the Literature Club?
Sayori likes eating cereal in front of a TV watching Saturday Morning Cartoons.         Okay probably not canonically but it definitely seems like something Sayori would do.
