Legend states of a crazy spider woman who lives deep in the Ancient Egyptian Pyramids, eating the remains of mummies. Nobody knows if she is real, or have lived to tell the tale. A blue-haired rapper guy went into the pyramids to see if the legends were true... He would soon regret it...
In the previous version, this song was a mashup of Dummy, Spider Dance, & Mad Mew Mew from Undertale. I originally intened to keep it, but with the copyright trouble with Toby Fox's music, I changed it while keeping some elements of it here.
Of all Bonus Songs, this one is one of two with a unique Game Over animation. (Nothing happens if you wait on it though)
I wouldn't really see the other Dokis here in this context. At least... not quite yet...
Could've called this Amy Likes Spiders and had Natsuki instead of Yuri, but no. I had to go with this. Missed opportunity, or is it?
