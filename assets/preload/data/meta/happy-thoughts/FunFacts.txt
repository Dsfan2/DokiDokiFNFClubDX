The instrumental of this song used to be... uhh... lacking, for lack of a better term, and now it sounds better.
When day is dark, alway rember: happi day!
There was an old Sayori oneshot mod that has now been privated due to the creator wanting to move on. This song was loosly based on the song from that mod.
I like having the happy thoughts! Don't you?
Sayori actually has a small ponytail where her bow is, and nobody noticed it 6 and a half years...
