I'm not claiming that Monika is a Dorodere because she is not evil. In fact, THAT'S why I'm making this mod in the first place.
Monika is best girl for all eternity. I will die on this hill!
In the DDLC 2018 Valentine's artworks, Monika canonically took the gifts the other girls made as her own. Get snuck upon.
If I had a nickel every time Monika got a Pop Up Parade figure, I'd have 2 nickels, which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice right?
The original version of this song was kinda... empty... so I gave it a backup melody now.
