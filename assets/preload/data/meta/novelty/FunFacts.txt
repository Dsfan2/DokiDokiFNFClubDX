When Yuri gets ice cream, she prefers to have both chocolate and raspberry together. Quite an odd combination, at least mint chocolate chip is acceptable, unless you hate Amanda The Adventurer.
Dandere is an anime character trope that involves a character being shy and quiet, yet wanting to make friends. It's name in Japaneese literally derives from the words for silence and lovey-dovey.
I originally wasn't gonna change Yuri's soundfont in this version, however, after multiple convising messages from lead artist 5hark, I made the decision to also change Yuri's soundfont too... Sorry Santiago...
I think Yuri has 2 hairclips, one on each side. Yuri's original sprite shows her hairclip on her left hair bang. But there are certain CGs that have Yuri's hairclip on her right hair bang.
Yuri would probably be considered as the most normal of the literature club... you know... before Act 2 happened... of course...
