This song was originally from the DDLC Plus Side Stories, but repurposed into FNF for my own amusement...
I've kept the Classic Songs because the previous versions of the mod could've been better. This is my attempt at this...
As much as I hated the V1 & V2 Sprites, there's actually talk of bringing the V1 Sprites back for DOKI DOKI Remixes. I prefer to keep the V2 Sprites burned forever.
The background for the clubroom is different in the Classic Songs is different than the Normal Songs.
I hated Yuri's old voice soundfonts, especially the V1 one... All the V1 ones were garbage... I hated them...
