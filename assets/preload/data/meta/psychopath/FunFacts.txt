This song now sounds so much better than the previous version. I know I sound like I'm beating a dead horse at this point by saying that again, but it bears bringing up multiple times due to how many upgrades these songs got.

Yuri's yandere expressions, spesifically her mouth sprites, were re-used from other characters. Spesifically Sayori & Natsuki.
There is now a reference to a Disney Junior show in this song. I'm not gonna say which one, but it's one that's not airing on the channel anymore...
Can You Feel The Sunshine was now demoted to being part of the instrumental at the end instead of the last of the vocals... Also the laugh is on the vocals track now...
