Respect is actually the name of one of the side stories in DDLC Plus, specifically the one featuring Monika & Natsuki.
The original version of this song sounded like a poorly done rendition of Hot Air Balloon from DDTO Plus and Dad Battle, so there's less of that here.
Natsuki needs respect for her opinions. Are you a good person that respects people's opinions?
The DOKI DOKI Remix of this song is gonna break you (When it releases)
You know there's a difference between stereotypical anime tsunderes and Natsuki, right?
