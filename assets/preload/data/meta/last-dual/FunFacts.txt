I just made this song Bowser Jr themed for no reason. I just wanted an excuse to do a Bowser Jr song before, I think...
This song prematurely ends like, a section after BF's final notes. I though the abrupt end was funny.
Originally in the story Boyfriend & Bowser Jr were singing because apparently that was one way for them to escape the game. That whole plot hole was removed in this version...
If DusterBuster can include a Va11-Hall-A song in Doki Doki Takeover Plus, then I have every right to include Bowser Jr in this mod!
You want this Grand Star so bad? You're gonna have to take it from me! >:3
