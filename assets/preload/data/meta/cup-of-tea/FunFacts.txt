Yuri canonically makes Oolong tea during the events of the original DDLC. It's unclear why she likes that kind of tea spesifically, but I ain't complaining.
Character heights have never been officially confirmed... But if they were they likely would've come from a deleted post on Twitter.
You might assume Yuri might look to be the oldest, but no. It's been confirmed through DDLC Plus that every character in the literature club is at least 18 years old. Oh boy...
