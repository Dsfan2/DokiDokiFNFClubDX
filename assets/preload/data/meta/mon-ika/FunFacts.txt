Somewhere, out on the ocean, you can hear a beautiful song. Some say it's the trick of a siren, others say it's a lonely mermaid wishing for a crowd to hear her song. A blue-haired rapper guy goes to the beach to investigate.
In the previous version, this song was literally just Bomb Rush Blush from Splatoon 2, and Monika was a squid mermaid. A lot has changed with this song, but I kept the name because of the joke that doesn't make sense in translation.
The other Dokis are also mermaids in this timeline, you only get to se just Monika though.
The Little Mermaid live action remake is worthless and terrible, and if my morals allowed it I'd straight-up exterminate that corprately greedy mouse myself.
If this is the first Bonus Song you chose to play, that means that the psychological effect of doing everything in order is working!
