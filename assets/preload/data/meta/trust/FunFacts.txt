Trust is actually the name of one of the side stories in DDLC Plus, specifically the one featuring Monika & Sayori.
The original version of this song had a repetitive instrumental melody, so I fixed it here...
Sayori needs good friends. Will you be a good friend to her?
Sayori jokes are not funny and very offensive... >:(
Deredere is the anime trope that serves as the base for every other -dere type anime trope. So why does Sayori fit this trope specifically? Is she really that basic?
